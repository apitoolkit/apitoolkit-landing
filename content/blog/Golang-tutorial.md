3. Get your API key: Don't forget to copy it to the clipboard or, even better, write it down. If you don't, you can lose access to that key in the future. Yes, I committed that error when accessing the API for the first time. 
4. The process of integrating is very simple: all you have to do is copy the code from the Golang docs into your own code, then paste your copied API key where it says API Key in angular brackets, and there you have it! You can go ahead and check your end points
