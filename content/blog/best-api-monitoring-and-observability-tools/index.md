With [API observability](https://apitoolkit.io/blog/what-is-api-testing/), out of sight shouldn’t mean out of mind. APIs work in the background using simple commands to move requests back and forth. Perhaps because they do a lot of background work, QA teams tend to neglect them.

API observability is an underrated yet hugely important aspect of quality assurance testing. One shouldn’t wait until a downtime occurs before jumping to fix broken or missing APIs. 

We’ve curated a list of the best API observability and monitoring tools to help make your QA processes seamless and improve your [API documentation](http://apitoolkit.io/blog/how-to-write-api-docs).
