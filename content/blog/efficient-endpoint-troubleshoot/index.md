## Real-Time Performance Monitoring

### Monitoring Transactions for Optimal Performance

Transactions are at the core of any API-based application. Monitoring the performance of these transactions in real-time is vital for ensuring optimal performance. APIToolkit offers transaction monitoring capabilities that provide insights into response times, throughput, and error rates. By monitoring transactions, you can identify potential bottlenecks, optimize performance, and enhance the overall user experience.

But what exactly are transactions? In the context of API-based applications, transactions refer to the interactions between the client and the server. These interactions can include requests for data, updates, or any other operation that involves communication between the client and the server. [Monitoring](https://apitoolkit.io/blog/database-monitoring/) these transactions allows you to gain visibility into how your API is performing and identify any issues that may arise.

### Keeping a Close Eye on Database Performance
