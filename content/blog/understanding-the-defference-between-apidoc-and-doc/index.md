It is debatable whether there is any real difference between documentation and API documentation other than the addition of codes and further minute details. So, we decided to discuss the distinctions between API documentation and documentation today as well as their respective significance.
 
## What is API Documentation?
The success of your APIs depends on the quality of the documentation. APIs are continuously evolving into the binding agent that holds our digital universe together. APIs are being used by businesses of all sizes to kickstart their digital transformation and expose their skills to a community of partners and developers to create fresh value from it.
 
API documentation is the reference manual for an API, it instructs API users on how to use the API. API documentation is written to be read and understood by humans, typically developers. To guarantee developers have a positive experience with the API, it is essential to provide well-designed, thorough, and simple-to-follow documentation. And an excellent developer experience increases the likelihood that an API will be successful. If your API documentation is difficult for developers to understand, they will probably locate another API that has better documentation and is simpler to integrate. The time it takes to onboard new API customers is also reduced by good documentation. Developers won't need to email your business, phone your customer service line, or ask questions in forums if they already have all the knowledge, they need to use your API.
 
The elements that make up excellent documentation include a quick start guide, tutorials, and interactive documentation that allows developers to test out API calls. To create and update API documentation, a variety of [documentation tools label](../C:/Hugo/apitoolkit-landing/content/blog/top-8-api-documentation-tools-for-developers) are available. A lot of these tools can generate API documentation automatically, both static and interactive, from an API definition file.
 
API documentation ought to include examples of each call, each parameter, and each call's answers. Code examples for popular programming languages including Java, JavaScript, PHP, and Python should be provided. Every API request, product, and endpoint should be explained in the documentation, along with illustrative samples of error messages. It's also crucial that API documentation is regularly updated and actively maintained to keep the user posted with updates and recent trends.
 
## What is a Documentation?
Documentation includes any text that describes the use, purpose, design, or architecture of a product or service. Its objective is to give a thorough description of a service that an organization offers. The term "documentation" is a general term that covers every kind of documentation including process documentation and product documentation.

Product documentation is a sort of technical document that contains information regarding a product or piece of software. It provides information on the manufactured item as well as instructions on how to utilize it to complete specific tasks. Product documentation is crucial to effective product management. Product managers must consider this while implementing product roadmap tools and product management software. The product documentation includes, examples, manuals, business rules, specifications, and technical specifications that enable people to get the most use and value out of the product in question. It can also be leveraged to enable users to interact with your business more deeply and work toward their objectives with increasing vigor. Product specifications, system requirements, setups, installation and configuration guidelines are just examples of the broad range of information covered in a product documentation. 

With thorough product documentation at their disposal, your users will recognize the primary characteristics of your product, find it easy to identify the features that are most appropriate for their use case and also provide explicit instructions on how to use each feature for its intended usage. As a result, people may approach your product with knowledge and assurance and always succeed in their goals when utilizing it. Although self-service entails more than just product documentation, it is an essential component. One benefit is that it provides users with the data they require at the right time. Additionally, strategic product documentation focuses on how this information is presented, ensuring that users can easily discover and understand the relevant information. Making this information accessible will help relieve some of the pressure on your support workers, as we'll explore. They will therefore be more qualified to assist users who actually require some hands-on help. Detailed product documentation lays out every aspect of a certain product so that users may absorb it all. Learn more about the sophisticated features and functions of your product from your present consumers. As a result, they can develop into power users and ultimately receive greater use out of your product over time.
 
The term "process documentation" refers to any written materials produced throughout the development and implementation of the process. Typical process-related documents include project management plans, test plans, reports, meeting minutes, and corporate correspondence. They also include guidelines and project documentation. An outline of how to carry out a task in your company is contained in a process guide. For instance, it might detail precisely how to move a certain portion of your data from legacy servers to the cloud. It could appear, as a rule, as a guide, or a flowchart. It may be found in your business plan, corporate handbook, document for new employee orientation, or cloud-based standard operating procedures. The act of capturing or documenting each step in a specific task is known as process documentation. In a perfect world, it would occur immediately. Employees record each action they take as they complete a task. Regular process reviews and ongoing process documentation allow staff and managers to identify what works and what doesn't, allowing everyone to modify the process manuals as the company grows.

In contrast to product documentation, which describes the final product and how consumers can fully utilize the product, process documentation chronicles the development and implementation strategy.
 
Both basic doc and API documentation are authored for users both explain the technicalities involved in the product. The fundamental distinction is that API documentation includes code blocks, endpoints, and other elements and not every one can fully understand API documentation whereas documentation is a generic term and can often be used to talk about any type of documentation but using this terms together might cause confusion since different people will understand it differently.
