### What is API Monitoring and API Observability

### API Monitoring
API monitoring refers to tracking and analyzing the performance and behavior of an API in real time. This includes metrics like response times, error rates, request volumes, and more. The goal of API monitoring is to identify issues early (before they become critical) by providing valuable insights into how your API behaves under different conditions.

### API Observability
API observability refers to tracking not just errors but also performance metrics such as response times, request volumes, and server health in real time. This allows developers to gain insights into how their application interacts with external services, which can be particularly useful when dealing with third party integrations or application interacts with external services, which can be essential for debugging issues or optimizing performance.

## Limitations of RapidAPI 

RapidAPI is a platform that provides access to over 80,000 APIs but doesn't offer native observability features like others do. This makes it difficult to get detailed insights into how your applications are interacting with these APIs. 

Additionally, While RapidAPI provides some great features such as documentation, testing, and mocking, they do lack in terms of observability. They don't offer dedicated dashboards where you can track the behavior of your APIs in real time. Additionally, their support for custom metrics is limited, and they do not provide detailed error messages which could be very useful for troubleshooting.

## Key Features of a Modern API Monitoring and Observability  Solution

* **Real-time monitoring**: This feature allows you to track how your API performs in real time. It provides insights into request rates, response times, error rates, etc., so you can identify bottlenecks or performance issues early on.

* **Alerting**: A good monitoring solution should provide alerts when certain thresholds are exceeded (e.g., too many failed requests within a short period). These alerts should be delivered via various channels such as email, SMS, or webhooks.

* **Traceability**: In complex systems with multiple microservices, it's important to have a way to trace requests from start to finish. The ability to see how different parts of an API interact with each other will help you understand where problems are coming from.

* **Security**: Security features like rate limiting, IP whitelisting/blacklisting can be added to prevent unauthorized access to your API.

* **Cost efficiency**: As your API grows in complexity and scale, the cost of running a monitoring solution should decrease while still providing valuable insights.

- [x] **Mock Responses**: Generate mock responses for your endpoints so you cantest them without relying  n external services or waiting for real responses. This makes it easier to develop and maintain your codebase.
- [x] **Rate Limiting**: Protect your API by setting custom rate limit rules based on IP addresses, user agents, or even specific paths within your API. This helps prevent abuse of your API and ensures fair usage policies are enforced. [Assertible](https://assertible.com/) offers these features alongside the ones listed above.

### Stoplight
Stoplight is another alternative to RapidAPI that provides similar functionality. It focuses more on design first rather than implementation first like Assertible does. They offer a visual interface where you can create Open first rather than implementation first like Mockoon does. However, both tools allow you to create mock servers first rather than implementation first like RapidAPI does.

The main difference between the two seems to be that RapidAPI encourages developers to start coding right away while Stoplight requires designing an API before implementing any code. Both platforms offer full OpenAPI/Swagger support which means they can handle anything from RESTful APIs to GraphQL servers.

![Stoplight and apitoolkit](./Stoplight.png)

### Features
- [x] **Assertions**: Write assertions in a simple, human-readable language that can be easily understood by anyone familiar with programming or testing concepts. The assertion syntax should be as close to natural English as possible. For example, "the response status code should be 200".

- [x] **Flexibility**: Allow users to write custom functions for more complex assertions. This could include things like calculating response times, checking against regular expressions, etc.

- [x] **Extensibility**: Make it easy for developers to add new assertion types and languages. Developers should be able to create their own assertion modules and plug them into the framework.

- [x] **Documentation:** Stoplight have extensive documentation available online. This includes detailed guides on how to use each tool as well as reference materials for specificfeatures. Having good documentation is crucial when using any API testing tool, as it allows you to understand how to leverage the tool's capabilities effectively.
