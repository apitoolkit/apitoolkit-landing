In fact almost every  up and running system make use of APIs on way or another. APIs act as the silent workhorses, facilitating seamless communication between applications and powering the digital experiences we rely on. 

However, APIs are fragile, and their malfunction can cause a lot to your websites,apps, system, frustrate users, and damage business reputation. This is where API monitoring becomes a critical lifeline, providing real-time insight into an API's health and performance. 

But with a plethora of tools available, selecting the right one can be daunting. While Sematext reigns as a popular choice, its feature set and pricing might not fit every need

## The Problem with Sematext
Sematext, a popular observability suite, offers log monitoring, synthetics, and RUM, but cracks start to show as your needs grow. While it boasts flexible pricing (plans begin at $50/month for logs and $29/month for monitor bundles), its shortcomings might leave you yearning for a better fit.

Sematext ticks some boxes with its full-stack coverage and seamless setup. You can even customize alerts, integrate with incident management systems, and leverage pre-built dashboards. 

However, while Sematext shines in many ways, it's not without its shadows. Some users note limitations in customizability, finding it challenging to tailor dashboards and alerts to their specific needs. 

Additionally, pricing plans can climb steeply for larger APIs or high monitoring volumes, potentially exceeding budgets.  ALso, limited integrations hamper tool synergy, transaction tracing is absent (making complex troubleshooting a nightmare), and costs can huge with scaling usage. 

And let's not forget the UI slowdown under data pressure and the Logsene search learning curve. Plus, inactive apps vanish after 31 days, and the 500MB/day free plan barely quenches data-thirsty APIs.
