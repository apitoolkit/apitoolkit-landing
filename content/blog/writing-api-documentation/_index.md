An API is only as good as the API documentation because a good API can be rendered useless if users don't know how to use it, a documentation is often essential for success in the API economy [Read more on API documentation](/blog/api-documentation-top-tools-and-using-them-right/). Nevertheless, it can be quite difficult to develop and keep up with effective documentation that is simple to read, entertaining to engage with, and helps the user succeed. The adoption and maintainance of APIs are directly impacted by creating excellent documentation, which involves time and effort. By choosing the appropriate API Application Tool like [Apitoolkit](https://app.apitoolkit.io), you can manage the documentation of your APIs much easier.  We've outlined a few best practices to assist your team in producing outstanding API documentation that your end users will like. 

## Guidelines For API Documentation
Let's list out some of the best practices to make your documentation truly sparkle for developers and decision-makers.
- Record all Request and Responses
There is never too much information provided in the API documentation. Users are unlikely to finish it in a single sitting regardless. When a user first begins using your API, they probably require some assistance until they have incorporated it into their workflow. Talk about things as simple as signing up, this may soud really simple, I mean who doesn't know how to sign up but it is neccessary.

- Arm your Documentation with Resources
You can give your customers more data and resources to help them use your API successfully and make their journey swift. The goal of a great API documentation is to help customers and prospects succeed with your API as soon as possible. It goes beyond the fundamental text provided. You can add to your documentation by using extra sources and tools.

- The Quick Start Guide
The Getting Started manual gives a thorough explanation of how to use your API right now. The focus of the guide should be on helping users succeed with your API as soon as possible and providing them with support along the way. This will give readers an excellent overview of integrating and using their API.

- SDKs and Libraries
Developers can quickly call many resources thanks to code libraries. Developers will feel more at ease using your API if there are quick and simple ways to use it in several languages. SDKs are challenging to create and are not necessary for launch, but they can significantly increase API use. Having SDKs is a fantastic method to interact with the developer community if your business strategy is based on a public or open API paradigm. In such a case, there is a significant probability that if developers see value in your SDKs and APIs, they will build upon it or add more libraries. The Swagger Codegen project enables teams to quickly create SDKs from their API documentation.

- Iteractive Console
Encourage potential customers to check what they read in the API documentation using the API console right away. A console makes getting started quick and easy, with no risk to the consumer. Experimentation is powerful. The work required to build a console or sandbox environment for users to interact with your API is rather low, but it can greatly aid engineers in understanding the value of your API graphically. Many organizations, including Microsoft and GitHub, provide interactive consoles for experimenting with their API services.

## Mistakes to AVOID
While there are best practices there are also mistakes to avoid if you want to have only good API documentation and they include:
### Avoid Using Jargon
Keep in mind that you have very little control over who will use your API. Your API will be used by users with a range of skill levels, and these users will read your API documentation. You want your API and its documentation to be friendly and helpful to both expert and novice users. Writers may fall into the trap of using excessive language, which has several negative effects. The plain language will persuade people to invest in your API much more effectively than complex technical jargon. Secondly, you want your API to be helpful to as many programmers as you can, regardless of their degree of experience. If you must use technical lingo, offer a link in your API documentation to a [glossary  explanation](https://rapidapi.com/blog/api-glossary/), or instructional that explains the term in question.

### Focusing on Competitors
Your documentation doesn't have to look like that of your competitors, remember your APIs dont work alike, so its important to draw your attention back to your API and focus on how to make every client and prospect satisfiesd with what you have to offer in a unique and straitforward way. 

### Bad Documentation Structurings
If its not organized then its a problem, every developer wants to have easy access to what they want in order to solve their problem as fast as they can. [You can take a look at a typical example of an organized documentation](https://app.apitoolkit.io) 


Finally, a good API documentation is worthwhile even when it takes time. It is a potent tool for accelerating the development and maturity of your APIs. It lays the groundwork for an excellent developer experience when using APIs. The aforementioned advice should make it simpler for you to create quality documentation. Teams may automate the documentation process and work on creating an excellent overall experience while accessing APIs thanks to popular open source description formats like OpenAPI Specification.
