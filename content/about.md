### Why APIToolkit 

A few years ago, I was a new hire at a food delivery company,
migrating a legacy service from PHP to Golang. We implemented the
fields listed in the swagger docs, and compared the responses from
the legacy service to the responses of the new service, fixing
differences until everything matched. 

After weeks of implementation and testing, 
we rolled out the new service after running tests to
make sure everything worked as expected. But immediately we looked
at our order monitoring charts, we knew we had messed up. Within
10mins, 20k orders lost. I was terrified. What happened?

Apparently in a couple countries we ran in, a particular field which
was expected by the apps was no longer being sent, prevent placing
of orders. We had no idea since this field was not in the inherited
documentation, and was only applicable in a couple countries which
were not part of the samples we manually tested. 

We rolled back and fixed the issue, 
but I was sad that there was no tool which could
have detected this issue faster.

Years later, this is that tool, and we would love to listen to
similar stories you've experienced, and help make such stories a
thing of the past.
