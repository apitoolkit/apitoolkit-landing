### Query, Analyze and Visualize

Our Log and Metrics Explorer tool is responsible for showing you information that is coming in and out of your server.

This is useful in a situation whereby there is an issue. You can use our Log Explorer to investigate traffic to and from your endpoints. For example, in a situation whereby there is an ongoing investigation for an error, a user can query and demand all the requests where the status code is not 200. Or, requests where the status code is above 200. Our logs and metrics tool will return a comprehensive result for the requested query, further helping with investigations.

In a nutshell, your API requests are logged for you on APIToolkit. You can query, explore and gain insight into the data hidden in your live API requests and responses.

With our Log Explorer, your imagination is your limit.
