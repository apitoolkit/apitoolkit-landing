### Detect and Track Slow Endpoints

Our powerful AI tool oversees your performance metrics: throughput, latency distribution, etc.

Latency distribution will inform you on how slow or fast your endpoint is. Throughput will notify you of how many requests per minute are coming into your endpoints, the error rates, speed, etc.

In a nutshell, our API Metrics detect and show you endpoint latency degradations, and our AI can suggest where there is room for improvement. For example, data that could be cached easily.
