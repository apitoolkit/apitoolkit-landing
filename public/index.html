        <h4>Or Why we are solving API observability</h4>
        <div class="pt-3 space-y-4 leading-7 text-base">
          <p>
            A few years ago, I was a new hire at a food delivery company,
            migrating a legacy service from PHP to Golang. We implemented the
            fields listed in the swagger docs, and compared the responses from
            the legacy service to the responses of the new service, fixing
            differences until everything matched. After weeks of implementation
            and testing, we rolled out the new service after running tests to
            make sure everything worked as expected. But immediately we looked
            at our order monitoring charts, we knew we had messed up. Within
            10mins, 20k orders lost. I was terrified. What happened?
          </p>
          <p>
            Apparently in a couple countries we ran in, a particular field which
            was expected by the apps was no longer being sent, prevent placing
            of orders. We had no idea since this field was not in the inherited
            documentation, and was only applicable in a couple countries which
            were not part of the samples we manually tested. We rolled back and
            fixed the issue, but I was sad that there was no tool which could
            have detected this issue faster.
          </p>
          <p>
            Years later, this is that tool, and we would love to listen to
            similar stories you've experienced, and help make such stories a
            thing of the past.

          <p>
            APIToolkit automatically listens to requests coming in and outside
            your services, and builds an understanding of what your API looks
            like. It uses this information to generate always up to date API
            documentation.

          <h3 class="text-xl">Get notified when your API contract is broken</h3>
          <p>
            Since APIToolkit has an always up to date model of your API, you can
            get notifications and alerts immediately something changes. Eg an
            important field is no more, or a new field has been added, or it’s
            format changed from a US date format to an EU date format
