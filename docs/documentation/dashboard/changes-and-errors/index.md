`Changes & Errors` feature gives you a real-time insights and control, helping to maintain functionality and improve user experience.  

## Changes and Errors in APItoolkit

Changes and Errors is a feature in APItoolkit that quickly lists all the changes made to your APIs in connection with APItoolkit. These changes can be related to your endpoints. The changes are not acknowledged unless you explicitly acknowledge them.


## How Changes and Errors improve workflow

This will increased visibility in your API modifications. Each change is displayed here on the change and error section of your dashboard.  

 #### For instance
 Let consider this change in our new endpoint

The events section can also be expanded to give you a broad overview of the various events happening within your connections.

We use the term `Changes` to describe both the modifications made to the events section itself and the events listed within it. This term is used in the events section of your connection's API Toolkit client interface.
