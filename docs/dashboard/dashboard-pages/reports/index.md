# Reports Page

In this guide, you will learn how to effectively navigate through the **Reports** page on the APItoolkit dashboard and maximize all the powerful features accessible in it.

```

On this page, you will find a history of all the email notification reports sent to members of the project. These reports will include a summary of detected anomalies and some performance details. You can choose to receive these reports daily or weekly by selecting any of the options at the top-left section of the page.

  <p>Aside from the general reports, APItoolkit will also send you transactional emails for when you create a new project, when a new member is added to a project, when you delete a project, and when a new anomaly is detected.</p>
