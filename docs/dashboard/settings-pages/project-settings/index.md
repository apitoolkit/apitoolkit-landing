# Project Settings

In this guide, you will learn how to effectively navigate through the **Project Settings** page on the APItoolkit dashboard and maximize all the powerful features accessible in it.

```=html
<hr />
```

On this page, you will find two sections, **Project Settings** and **Project Notifications**. In Project Settings, you can edit your project details (title, timezone, description, and plan) and in Project Notifications you can configure your email or Slack workspace.

To get to this page, kindly click on the project name at the top-left section of the dashboard and then click on the **Settings** tab. You will then be redirected to another page where you can make the changes or delete your project.
