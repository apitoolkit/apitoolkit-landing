# API Testing

APItoolkit allows you to create tests and assertions to verify some defined parameters in the responses of your API in real-time. With this, you can validate your APIs and test different scenarios across different deployment environments.

Some **key benefits** and popular **use cases** include the ability to:

- Validate your APIs and test different scenarios across different deployment environments.
- Run active end-to-end monitors on any APIs, and assert if key use cases work as expected.
- Schedule tests to run at intervals and configure specific checks and assertions.
- See all changes and issues at a glance so your engineering or support team can prioritize what issues need to be fixed immediately or not.
- Watch errors, stack traces, performance stats, and other metrics that matter, so you can pinpoint API issues, understand the root cause(s), and fix them in real-time.
- Effortlessly capture the entire request-response chain, allowing you to reproduce complex issues with ease and get to the bottom of them fast.
- Set alerts to track certain requests when they cross certain thresholds and notify relevant members of your team via email or Slack when the alert is triggered.
- And a lot more!
