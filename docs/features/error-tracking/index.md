# Error Tracking

APItoolkit allows you to find and fix errors and breaking changes affecting your users in real-time. With this, you can catch changes in your APIs (incoming requests) and third-party integrations (outgoing requests) with enough context to reproduce the issues and narrow down the root cause.

Some **key benefits** and popular **use cases** include the ability to:

- See all changes and issues at a glance so your engineering or support team can prioritize what issues need to be fixed immediately or not.
- Watch errors, stack traces, performance stats, and other metrics that matter, so you can pinpoint API issues, understand the root cause(s), and fix them in real-time.
- Effortlessly capture the entire request-response chain, allowing you to reproduce complex issues with ease and get to the bottom of them fast.
- Set alerts to track certain requests when they cross certain thresholds and notify relevant members of your team via email or Slack when the alert is triggered.
- And a lot more!
