An outgoing request is an API request made from one server to another (e.g., a request to an external API inside another API).

## Percentile

A percentile is a statistical term that indicates the value below which a specific percentage of data points fall in comparison to the remainder of the data. For example, a value at the 75th percentile indicates that 75% of the data points are below that value and 25% are above it. Percentiles are commonly used to analyze the distribution of a dataset and to identify outliers or anomalies. Common percentiles include: 25th percentile (Q1), 50th percentile (median or Q2), 75th percentile (Q3), 90th percentile, 95th percentile, and 99th percentile.

## POST Request

A POST request is a type of HTTP request method that is used to send data to a server to create or update a resource. It is commonly used in web applications to submit form data or send data to an API endpoint. The data sent in a POST request is typically included in the body of the request rather than in the URL.

## Private API

A private API refers to an application programming interface that is intended for internal use within a specific organization or company. It is not publicly accessible or available for use by external developers or third-party applications. Private APIs are designed to enable communication and data exchange between different software systems or components within the organization, ensuring secure and controlled access to specific functionalities.

It provides a standardized way for developers to access and use the functionalities and data of a particular software or service, enabling them to integrate it into their applications or build upon it.

## PUT Request

A PUT request is a type of HTTP request method used to update or replace an existing resource on a server. It is typically used to modify specific data or properties of a resource, with the request body containing the updated information. The PUT request is idempotent, meaning that multiple identical requests will have the same effect as a single request.

## Query Parameters

Query parameters are used in web development to pass information between a client and a server. They are appended to the end of a URL and consist of key-value pairs, separated by an ampersand. These parameters allow for customization and filtering of data requested from a server, such as specifying which page of a paginated dataset to retrieve or filtering a list of resources based on specific criteria.

## Rate Limiting

The practice of limiting the number of API requests a user can make in a given time frame. It’s used to control access to an API and prevent abuse. For example, an API might limit clients to 100 requests per minute to maintain service stability.

## RESTful API

A RESTful API is a type of application programming interface that follows the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST). It allows communication between different software systems over the internet using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and others. RESTful API is stateless, meaning each HTTP request happens independently and does not depend on previous requests, and is widely used due to its simplicity, efficiency, and ability to build web services that are lightweight and maintainable.

## SaaS API

SaaS API refers to a software-as-a-service application programming interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. This enables developers to integrate third-party services or build custom applications on top of a SaaS platform.

It's a communication protocol that allows different software systems to exchange data over the internet using the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). It uses XML for message format and HTTP for transport, and it's known for its extensibility and independence from operating systems, making it versatile for various applications.

## Streaming API

A type of API that allows continuous data transmission between a client and a server. It’s commonly used in applications that require real-time updates, like stock price updates or social media feeds. Data is sent in small 'chunks' without waiting for all data to be available, facilitating live updates.

## Token Authentication

A method in API security where a token is used to verify identity and grant access. Typically, a client requests access from an authorization server and, upon successful authentication, receives a token. This token is then used in subsequent requests to access the API.

## Throughput

Throughput refers to the rate at which an amount of data is transmitted over a given period.

## Webhook

A webhook is a method of communication that allows two applications to exchange data in real time. It involves one application sending a POST request to a specific URL provided by another application, triggering an event or action.
