## Streamline Error Analysis with Advanced Sorting

When dealing with a large number of errors, it becomes critical to filter out irrelevant ones and focus on the most important issues. APIToolkit offers advanced sorting techniques that allow you to prioritize errors based on their severity, frequency, or impact on user experience. By utilizing these sorting capabilities, you can streamline your error analysis process and focus on resolving critical issues first.

Additionally, APIToolkit's sorting capabilities allow you to prioritize errors based on their frequency. This means that you can identify recurring errors that may be indicative of underlying issues in your codebase. By addressing these recurring errors, you can improve the overall stability and reliability of your application, leading to a better user experience.

Furthermore, APIToolkit's advanced sorting techniques also enable you to prioritize errors based on their impact on user experience. This means that you can identify errors that directly affect your users' interactions with your [Identifying the Root Cause of Application Errors: A Guide to Error Monitoring](https://apitoolkit.io/blog/application-errors-a-guide-to-error-monitoring), such as slow page load times or broken functionality. By addressing these user-facing errors, you can enhance the overall usability and satisfaction of your application, ultimately leading to increased user engagement and retention.

## Enhance Error Resolution with Comprehensive Context

Gathering essential information about errors is vital for effective debugging and resolution. APIToolkit captures detailed error context, including stack traces, HTTP requests, and user session data. Having access to this comprehensive context significantly enhances your ability to understand and resolve errors efficiently.

When it comes to debugging and resolving errors in your application, having access to comprehensive context is crucial. APIToolkit goes above and beyond by capturing detailed information about the errors that occur in your system. This includes not only the stack traces, but also the HTTP requests that led to the error and the user session data at the time of the error.

Imagine a scenario where a critical error occurs in your application. Without the proper context, it can be challenging to pinpoint the root cause of the issue. However, with APIToolkit, you can easily access all the relevant information you need to understand what went wrong.

Let's say a user encounters an error while using your web application. With APIToolkit, you can see the exact sequence of HTTP requests that led to the error. This includes the request method, URL, headers, and even the request payload. By examining this information, you can quickly identify any potential issues with the API calls or server-side code.

In addition to the HTTP requests, APIToolkit also captures the user session data at the time of the error. This includes details such as the user's ID, email, and any other relevant information. Having access to this data can be invaluable when it comes to reproducing and resolving the error.

Furthermore, APIToolkit provides detailed stack traces for each error. This allows you to trace the exact path through your code that led to the error. Examining the stack trace can help you can identify the specific functions and methods that were involved in the error, making it easier to pinpoint the root cause.

## Uncover Insights through Error Querying

While error analysis is essential, gaining deeper insights into errors requires more than just analyzing individual occurrences. APIToolkit allows you to leverage powerful data queries to analyze error trends and patterns over time. By querying error data, you can identify recurring issues and take proactive measures to prevent them from negatively impacting your application.

## Stay on Top of Errors with Instant Notifications

Real-time error alerts are crucial for efficient issue tracking and resolution. APIToolkit provides instant notifications whenever a new error occurs, allowing you to take immediate action. With real-time error alerts, you can stay on top of errors and address them before they escalate.

## Improve Frontend Performance with Real User Monitoring

Optimizing website speed is essential for delivering an exceptional user experience. APIToolkit offers real user monitoring (RUM) capabilities that provide real-time insights into your frontend performance. By monitoring key metrics such as page load time, rendering, and network latency, you can identify potential bottlenecks and optimize your application for better performance.

### Understanding Google's Core Web Vitals for Performance Optimization

Google's Core Web Vitals are a set of metrics that gauge user experience and website performance. APIToolkit helps you track these core vitals to ensure your website meets the standards set by Google. Therefore, continuously monitoring your core web vitals can help you identify areas that require improvement and take proactive measures to enhance your website's performance.

### Monitoring Page Performance for Seamless User Experience

Tracking page performance is crucial for ensuring a seamless user experience. APIToolkit allows you to monitor key metrics such as page load time, DOMContentLoaded, and first input delay. By keeping a close eye on these performance indicators, you can proactively address any issues that may hinder your users' browsing experience.
