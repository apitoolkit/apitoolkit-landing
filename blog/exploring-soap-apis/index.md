The header is tasked with carrying crucial meta-information such as authentication details and transaction controls, which are essential for the accurate processing of the message. The body holds the actual request or response data. It's this stringent structure that bestows SOAP APIs with their acclaimed reliability and security.

Another key aspect of [SOAP APIs](https://apitoolkit.io/blog/everything-about-soap-apis/) is the WSDL, or Web Services Description Language. Imagine this as the instruction manual that comes with the envelope, explaining how to use it effectively. It describes the services offered, how to send requests, and what responses to expect, ensuring that anyone who uses the API can do so efficiently and accurately.

Understanding these aspects of SOAP APIs is like learning the art of sophisticated digital communication. They are especially valuable in scenarios where secure, detailed, and reliable message exchange is crucial. As we explore further, we'll see how these elements come together to benefit businesses and streamline complex digital interactions.

### SOAP Request Example

```xml
POST /WeatherService HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: length
SOAPAction: "http://api.example.com/GetWeather"

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
               xmlns:web="http://api.example.com/webservice">
    <soap:Header>
        <!-- Header information (like authentication, etc.) -->
    </soap:Header>
    <soap:Body>
        <web:GetWeatherRequest>
            <web:City>New York</web:City>
        </web:GetWeatherRequest>
    </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

In this SOAP request:

- The `Envelope` element is the root of the SOAP message.
- The `Header` element is optional and can contain additional information like authentication.
- The `Body` element contains the actual request - in this case, a request for weather information for New York.

### SOAP Response Example

```xml
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: length

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
               xmlns:web="http://api.example.com/webservice">
    <soap:Body>
        <web:GetWeatherResponse>
            <web:Temperature>75</web:Temperature>
            <web:Condition>Sunny</web:Condition>
        </web:GetWeatherResponse>
    </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

In the SOAP response:

- The `Envelope` and `Body` are similar to the request structure.
- The `GetWeatherResponse` element contains the response data - in this case, the temperature and weather condition.
