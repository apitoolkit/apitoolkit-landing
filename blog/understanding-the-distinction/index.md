# Understanding the Distinction: Synthetic API Monitoring vs API Real User Monitoring

![Synthetic API vs API Real User Monitoring](synthetic-api-vs-api-real-user-monitoring.png)

Performance and dependability of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are essential for any business. [API monitoring](https://apitoolkit.io/blog/best-api-monitoring-and-observability-tools/) plays a vital role in maintaining the seamless functioning of applications and delivering exceptional user experiences. However, there are two different approaches to API monitoring: Synthetic API Monitoring and API Real User [Monitoring](https://apitoolkit.io/blog/best-api-monitoring-and-observability-tools/) (RUM).

## Streamlining Navigation with Skip Links

Skip links are an essential component of website accessibility. They allow users to navigate directly to specific content on a page, bypassing repetitive or irrelevant sections. By streamlining navigation, skip links enhance the overall user experience, especially for those using assistive technologies.

Imagine you are visiting a website that has a long and complex navigation menu. Without skip links, you would have to scroll through the entire menu to find the content you are looking for. This can be time-consuming and frustrating, especially for individuals with visual impairments or motor disabilities.

However, with the implementation of skip links, users can easily skip over the navigation menu and jump directly to the main content of the page. This not only saves time but also reduces cognitive load, allowing users to focus on the information that is most relevant to them.

### Enhancing Accessibility with Skip Links

Accessibility is a core principle in web development. Skip links are an effective way to make websites more accessible for users with disabilities. By providing shortcuts to content, individuals can quickly jump to the information they need without having to navigate through every section of a page.

For example, imagine a user with a visual impairment who relies on a screen reader to access web content. Without skip links, the screen reader would have to read through the entire page, including the navigation menu and other repetitive elements, before reaching the main content. This can be overwhelming and time-consuming for the user.

However, by incorporating skip links, the user can skip directly to the main content, bypassing the navigation menu and any other irrelevant sections. This not only improves the user experience but also ensures that individuals with disabilities have equal access to information on the web. Moreover, skip links can also benefit users who have cognitive disabilities or attention disorders. These individuals may find it challenging to navigate through complex menus or lengthy pages. With skip links, they can quickly jump to the specific content they are interested in, without getting lost or overwhelmed by the surrounding elements.

Skip links are a valuable tool for enhancing website accessibility. By providing shortcuts to content, they streamline navigation and improve the user experience for individuals with disabilities. Whether it's a visually impaired user relying on a screen reader or someone with cognitive challenges, skip links ensure that everyone can easily access the information they need on the web.
