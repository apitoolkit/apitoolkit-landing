# How to Resolve API Downtime Issues Before It Escalates

![A Representation of API Downtime on a Laptop Device](./api_downtime.png)

Imagine waking up to an API outage that has cost your business $100,000 in just five hours. That, my friend, can be so heart-rending. Truth is, APIs are great, but APIs can fail. And this, without warning. In this blog post, weâ€™ll explore incident recovery and how to solve API downtime issues before they escalate.

## What is API Downtime?

API downtime, also known as an API outage, occurs when an endpoint is unavailable due to errors or service disruptions. This means the API fails to meet its expected service level agreement (SLA) or quality of service (QoS) standards, crucial metrics that define its availability, performance, reliability, and security. For example, an API with an SLA promising 99.9% uptime should be operational 99.9% of the time. Falling short of this, even by 0.1%, constitutes a breach of its SLA.

Technical factors heavily influence API performance, necessitating tools to ensure their health. Inadequate performance and poor security are primary causes of API downtime.

## Understanding API Downtime

While APIs remain the backbone of [modern digital businesses](https://apitoolkit.io/blog/api-as-a-product/), they are susceptible to downtime. Downtime is the period when an API is unavailable or unresponsive due to technical issues, network failures, security threats, human errors, or malicious attacks. Downtime can have serious consequences for businesses and users who rely on APIs for their daily operations and interactions. These server issues like hardware failures or bandwidth limitations, application bugs, cyberattacks like DDoS, or simple human errors like accidental deletion can disrupt API functionality. This disruption can result in direct financial losses or indirect damages such as reduced customer satisfaction.

## Causes of API Downtime

There are many possible causes of API downtime, such as:

- **Server or network issues**: Issues like hardware malfunctions, power disruptions, limited bandwidth, network congestion, or misconfigurations can critically impact the servers or networks hosting or connecting to the API.

- **Application issues**: Software bugs, memory leaks, resource exhaustion, or incompatible updates can cause the API to malfunction or crash.

- **Security issues**: Cyber threats like denial-of-service (DoS), distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, or data breaches can threaten the security and accessibility of the API and its data.

- **Human issues**: Cyber threats like denial-of-service (DoS), distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, or data breaches can threaten the security and accessibility of the API and its data.

## Impact of API Downtime on Businesses

API downtime can have a significant impact on businesses and users who depend on APIs for their core functions and features. Some of the negative effects of API downtime include:

- **Financial losses**: Businesses may face revenue loss, increased costs, or even contractual penalties due to API downtime. For instance, an e-commerce platform with a malfunctioning payment API could miss sales, while a cloud provider facing storage API issues might need to compensate clients for SLA breaches.

- **Brand damage**: API downtime can tarnish a business's reputation. Users frustrated by a downed social media messaging API or patients endangered by an inaccessible healthcare data API might lose trust in these platforms.

- **Competitive disadvantage**: Businesses can lose their competitive edge due to API downtime. For example, if a travel booking site's flight information API is down, it may lose customers to its competitors who offer more reliable and accurate information.

## The Cost of API Downtime

API downtime can be very costly for businesses in terms of both direct and indirect losses. Direct losses are the measurable financial losses that result from reduced revenue, increased expenses, or legal liabilities due to API downtime. Indirect losses are intangible losses that result from reduced customer satisfaction, loyalty, retention, or acquisition due to API downtime.

The exact cost of API downtime depends on various factors such as:

- **The type and scale of the business**: Different businesses have different revenue models and customer bases that affect how much they rely on APIs and how much they lose when APIs are down. For example, a large online retailer may lose more money per minute of downtime than a small local store.

- **The type and scope of the API**: Different APIs have different functionalities and dependencies that affect how critical they are for the business and how widespread their impact is when they are down. For example, a core API that supports multiple features or services may cause more disruption than a peripheral API that supports a single feature or service.

- **The type and severity of the downtime**: Different downtimes have different durations and frequencies that affect how long and how often they affect the business and its customers. For example, a prolonged outage may cause more damage than a brief interruption.

- **The type and size of the audience**: Different audiences have different expectations and behaviors that affect how they react to and cope with API downtime. For example, a loyal customer may be more forgiving than a new customer.

A [report by the IDC](https://www.devopsdigest.com/idc-survey-appdynamics-devops-application-performance#:~:text=Unplanned%20application%20downtime%20costs%20the%20Fortune%201000%20from,of%20Downtime%3A%20Fortune%201000%20Best%20Practice%20Metrics%20Quantified.) suggests that Fortune 1000 companies lose between $1.25 billion and $2.5 billion every year because of application outages. A company that brings in more than $1 billion in annual revenue could lose around $686,000 in revenue per minute of downtime.

According to some incident management estimates, the average cost of API downtime for a large enterprise can range from $5,600 to $11,600 per minute, depending on the industry and the scenario. This translates to $336,000 to $696,000 per hour, or $8.06 million to $16.7 million per day. For some high-profile cases, the cost of API downtime can be even higher. For example, in 2017, Amazon's S3 cloud storage service [experienced a four-hour outage](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2017/03/02/aws-outage-that-broke-the-internet-caused-by-mistyped-command/) that affected many websites and services that relied on it. The outage was estimated to have cost Amazon and its customers around $150 million in lost revenue.

## Proactive Approach to API Downtime Prevention

The best way to minimize the cost and impact of API downtime is to [prevent it from happening in the first place](https://apitoolkit.io/blog/why-you-need-an-api-monitoring-tool/). This is proper incident management. And it requires a proactive approach that involves:

- Implementing robust monitoring and alert systems
- Conducting regular performance and stress testing, and
- Following best practices for API design and development.

### Implementing Robust Monitoring and Alert Systems

Monitoring and alert systems are [essential tools for detecting and diagnosing API issues](https://apitoolkit.io/blog/best-api-monitoring-and-observability-tools/) before they escalate into downtime incidents. They help businesses measure and track the health and performance of their APIs, identify and isolate the root causes of problems, and notify and alert the relevant stakeholders and teams when issues occur.

Some of the key components of a robust monitoring and alert system are:

- **Real-time monitoring tools**: These are software applications or services that collect and analyze data from various sources such as servers, networks, applications, APIs, or users. They provide metrics and indicators such as availability, response time, throughput, error rate, or user satisfaction. They also provide dashboards and visualizations that display the current status and trends of the API performance and health.

- **Proactive alert mechanisms**: These are software applications or services that send notifications or warnings to the appropriate parties when certain conditions or thresholds are met or exceeded. They can use various channels such as email, SMS, phone call, or push notifications. They can also trigger automated actions such as restarting a server, scaling up a resource, or launching a backup system.

### Conducting Regular Performance and Stress Testing

Performance and stress testing are methods of evaluating the capacity, scalability, reliability, and resilience of an API under various load and stress scenarios. They help businesses ensure that their APIs can handle the expected and unexpected demand from their users and customers, as well as cope with potential failures or attacks.

Some of the key aspects of performance and stress testing are:

- **Load testing**: This is the process of simulating normal or peak traffic conditions to measure how the API performs under different load levels. It helps businesses determine the optimal configuration and allocation of resources for their APIs, as well as identify any performance bottlenecks or issues.

- **Stress testing**: This is the process of simulating extreme or abnormal traffic conditions to measure how the API performs under high-stress levels. It helps businesses determine the maximum capacity and limit of their APIs, as well as identify any scalability or resilience issues.

## Building Redundancy for High Availability

Redundancy is the practice of having multiple copies or backups of an API or its components in case one fails or becomes unavailable. Redundancy helps businesses achieve high availability (HA), which is the ability of an API to remain operational and accessible at all times. HA is often measured by uptime percentage, which is the ratio of the time that an API is available to the total time that it is expected to be available.
