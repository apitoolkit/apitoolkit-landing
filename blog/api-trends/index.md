## 5. Improvement in API Security Standards

In a [2021 report by Postman](https://www.postman.com/state-of-api/api-first-strategies/#api-first-strategies), when asked about the factors that are considered before integrating with an API, more than two-thirds of survey respondents mentioned these four factors: security, [performance](https://apitoolkit.io/api-anomalies-validation-and-checks/), reliability, and [documentation](https://apitoolkit.io/api-documentation-and-developer-portals/).

API security refers to the protection of [API integrity](https://apitoolkit.io/blog/api-documentation-and-observability-the-truth-you-must-know/). Organizations that adopt AI and ML technology should especially make API security a priority because AI and ML require massive amounts of data, and security practices to scale, protect, and better serve customers.

Security measures cover a lot of schemes, including API key, HTTP Basic Authentication, and OpenID Connect.

Besides, you need to understand if the company’s infrastructure is secure, establish a practice of regular infrastructure and application penetration testing, and detect if you have any vulnerabilities.

## 6. GraphQL Adoptability will Accelerate

Gartner predicts that by 2025, more than 50% of enterprises will use [GraphQL in production](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/api-management/7-ideas-for-the-future-of-apis), up from less than 10% in 2021. [REST API](https://apitoolkit.io/blog/everything-about-rest-apis/) remians the most widely used standard for creating APIs, however, developers are increasingly tilting towards GraphQL because of its adaptability and simplicity.

The acceleration of GraphQL adoptability is a paradigm shift in how APIs are consumed and delivered. [GraphQL](https://apitoolkit.io/blog/rest-api-is-the-future/) empowers front-end developers by giving them more control over the data they fetch, reducing the back-and-forth with back-end teams and speeding up the development process. It also offers strong typing and introspection, making it easier to build and maintain robust APIs. As we move through 2024, GraphQL is expected to become even more popular, potentially becoming the go-to standard for API development, especially for complex systems and microservices architectures.

## 7. APIs will become Ubiquitous and Hyperconnected

[APIs](https://apitoolkit.io/blog/fintech-api/) have, no doubt, become increasingly ubiquitous, with businesses of all sizes using them to power their applications and services. We can expect to see this trend continue in 2024, as more businesses adopt an API-first approach to development. Whether it's integrating with third-party services, enabling mobile applications, or facilitating cloud migrations, APIs are at the heart of virtually every digital interaction.

The ubiquity and hyperconnectivity of [APIs](https://apitoolkit.io/blog/fintech-api/) are driving a new wave of innovation and collaboration. Businesses are now able to tap into a vast array of services and capabilities, from payment processing and geo-location to machine learning and data analytics, all through APIs. This has led to the rise of API marketplaces and ecosystems where companies can buy, sell, and share APIs, further accelerating digital transformation. As we move through 2024, we can expect APIs to become even more integral to how businesses operate and innovate, with an increasing focus on standardization, discoverability, and real-time data exchange.

## 8. The Adoption of Microservices Will Promote the Development of APIs

In the previous five years, the use of microservices has increased dramatically, and adoption is anticipated to continue growing. Microservices architectures are widely used because of its reusable and modular service design. It makes sense to build microservices using an API-driven model.

Allied Market Research predicts that the market share of microservices will increase linearly. Also, as more companies begin to use microservices, they will adopt an API-driven strategy to support them. The scalability and flexibility required to support a decoupled microservices architecture will be made possible by these APIs.

## 9. More APIs will provide serverless architecture

[Serverless computing](https://www.ibm.com/topics/serverless) is a popular trend in the cloud computing space. In 2024, we can expect to see more APIs that support serverless architecture. This will make it easier for businesses to develop and deploy APIs without having to worry about managing servers.

The shift towards serverless APIs is a change in the operational mindset for businesses. Businesses are now looking at serverless architecture as a way to accelerate development cycles, reduce time-to-market, and optimize resource utilization. The pay-as-you-go model of serverless computing ensures that businesses only pay for the compute power they actually use, making it a cost-effective solution for APIs that experience variable traffic. As we proceed through 2024, the adoption of serverless architecture for APIs is expected to grow, offering businesses greater flexibility and efficiency in their API strategies.

## 10. API Management takes Centre Stage

As APIs become increasingly integral to business operations and strategies, the need for effective API management is more critical than ever. API management involves not just the creation and deployment of APIs, but also their [monitoring](https://apitoolkit.io/blog/api-documentation-and-observability-the-truth-you-must-know/), security, scaling, and analytics.

As businesses expose more of their services through APIs, the risks associated with poor API management—such as security vulnerabilities, data breaches, and service outages—become increasingly severe. Effective [API management](https://apitoolkit.io/blog/anomalies-in-restful-apis/) allows organizations to mitigate these risks while maximizing the value they derive from their APIs. As we move through 2024, expect to see [API management](https://apitoolkit.io/blog/anomalies-in-restful-apis/) becoming a core competency for businesses, with a greater emphasis on governance, compliance, and analytics.
