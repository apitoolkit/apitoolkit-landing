# API Monitoring and Documentation: The Truth You Must Know

![API Connectivity around a Chain of Programs](./apiblogcover.jpg)

Connectivity is one fantastic thing that has put the world at our fingertips, and technology has made this even easier with the use of APIs. The technology stack behind API monitoring and documentation has ensured secure and reliable connectivity across a vast chain of programs. APIs have made lives more manageable.

How do you think apps and websites let you create an account and log in with your Facebook or Google credentials? Or how do weather apps get the day’s forecast? The answer to both questions is that they talk to other systems to get the data or verify your credentials. These two systems talk to each other through an API or Application Programming Interface.

## What is an API?

In simple terms, an API (Application Programming Interface) is a software intermediary that allows two applications to interact with each other, handling requests and returning the appropriate data. It’s a messenger that takes requests from one application to another; tells it what you want to do, and then returns a response back to you.

According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/googlecloud/2022/01/19/research-shows-api-management-fuels-growth-heres-why/?sh=4f258ac51713), the market capitalization of companies that have adopted APIs has grown by more than 12% compared to those that have not adopted APIs. And [RapidAPI](https://research.aimultiple.com/api-statistics/) states that more than 90% of executives describe APIs as mission-critical.

Over 90% of programmers use APIs.

APIs have created the connectivity that puts the world at our fingertips.

## Key Components of an API

APIs have the following standard key components:

- **Endpoint:** A specific URL that represents and/or serves as a point of entry to a resource during an API call.

- **Request:** An action made to an API endpoint, usually including a method (e.g. GET, POST) and any necessary parameters.

- **Response:** The data returned by an API in response to a request, typically in a format such as JSON or XML.

- **Authentication:** A process that verifies the identity of a client making a request to an API.

- **Authorization:** A process that determines whether a client has the necessary permissions to access a requested resource.

- **HTTP status codes:** Codes returned by an API in response to a request, indicating the success or failure of the request (e.g. 200 OK, 401 Unauthorized).

- **Documentation:** Information that explains how to use an API, including a description of its endpoints, request format, and expected responses.

## API Documentation

APIs have become increasingly important in recent years as they allow different software systems to communicate with each other and exchange data. They have been widely adopted across various industries such as technology, healthcare, finance, and more. However, behind the successful use of an API to send and receive requests is API documentation.

### What is API Documentation?

API documentation is a crucial aspect of software development that provides information about the functionality and use of an application programming interface (API). It serves as a reference for developers who want to integrate their applications with the API and for users who want to understand how to use the API effectively.

### Why is API Documentation Important?

API documentation plays a vital role in ensuring that an API is easy to understand and use. It’s the equivalent of a primer or product guide. API documentation helps to bridge the gap between the API creators and API users by providing clear and concise information about the API’s capabilities, inputs, outputs, and error handling.

Also, API documentation helps to increase the adoption of an API, as it enables developers to quickly and easily integrate their applications with the API. This leads to increased productivity and reduced development time, as developers don’t have to spend time figuring out how the API works.

As a standard practice, your API documentation should be as detailed as possible.

Take for instance, a developer is using an API to retrieve data from a database. If the API documentation includes detailed descriptions of the endpoints, request and response structures, and error codes, the developer can quickly understand how the API works and what to expect when they make requests.

However, if the documentation doesn't include this information, the developer may struggle to figure out why they're not getting the expected results, leading to frustration and wasted time and resources.

Ensuring that your API documentation is well-detailed and easy to understand increases your patronage and revenue.

## Essential Elements of API Documentation

1. Endpoints: A clear and comprehensive list of all the endpoints that the API offers.
2. Request and Response examples: Detailed examples of the requests and responses for each endpoint, including the expected input parameters, output format, and response codes.
3. Error handling: Information about the error codes and messages that the API may return and the conditions that trigger them.
4. Authentication and authorization: Information about the authentication and authorization mechanisms supported by the API.
5. Security: A description of the security measures that the API has in place to protect sensitive data.
6. Rate limits: Information about the rate limits for each endpoint, including the maximum number of requests per unit of time.
7. SDKs and code samples: Code samples and software development kits (SDKs) that make it easier to integrate with the API.

### API Documentation Best Practices

Creating highly useful API documentation requires intelligent effort and strategy. Below are some key things you should take cognizance of:

1. Use clear and concise language: You should write your API documentation in a clear, concise, and easy-to-understand manner, using plain language and avoiding loads of technical jargon.
2. Keep it up-to-date: Regularly update API documentation to ensure that it remains accurate and relevant.
3. Make it accessible: Ensure that API documentation is easily accessible, either through a dedicated documentation portal or through the API itself.
4. Use examples: Use examples and code snippets to help developers understand how to use the API.
5. Make it visually appealing: Use graphics, tables, and other visual elements to make the API documentation more appealing and easier to understand.
6. Document all endpoints and parameters: Make sure your API documentation lists all endpoints and parameters. This includes the endpoint URL, HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, etc.), request parameters, and response format. It's also important to specify any constraints or limitations on the use of the API, such as rate limits.
7. Provide error codes and messages: Your API documentation should also include a list of all error codes and messages that may be returned by the API. This helps developers understand what went wrong and how to fix the problem.

API documentation plays a crucial role in the success of any API. It is the face of the API and the first point of contact between the API provider and its consumers. Taking a meticulous effort to write clean API documentation can make your API easy to understand and use, resulting in increased adoption and satisfaction among developers.

## API Monitoring and Documentation

Gone are the days of just writing or following API documentation and calling it a wrap. If your API connectivity is of any importance to you, then you have to make API monitoring and observability an integral part of your API framework.

Nowadays, API documentation and monitoring go hand-in-hand.

Monitoring and observability play a crucial role in API documentation as it helps developers understand API behavior and how it can be used in different scenarios. Observability provides visibility into the API's performance, errors, and usage patterns. This helps developers and enterprises quickly diagnose and resolve issues, leading to improved overall API reliability and user satisfaction.

In API documentation, monitoring and observability can be achieved through detailed descriptions of the API's endpoints, request and response structures, error codes, and response times. Additionally, monitoring and logging tools can be used to track the API's performance, availability, and usage patterns in real time.

## Major Causes of API Downtime

Any company, big or small, may suffer [API downtime](https://apitoolkit.io/blog/api-downtime/) at some point, resulting in revenue loss and lost customer trust. This is generally bad for business.

Discussed below are some of the major factors that cause API downtimes:

1. **Server failure:** The physical or virtual servers hosting the API can fail, leading to an API downtime.

2. **Network issues:** Network issues such as congestion, routing problems, and data loss can lead to API downtime.

3. **Traffic spikes:** If an API is not designed to handle high volumes of traffic, it may become unavailable or slow down during periods of high usage.

4. **Resource exhaustion:** When an API is overwhelmed by too many requests, it can lead to resource exhaustion and API downtime.

5. **Configuration errors:** Improper configuration of the API or its dependencies can cause the API to fail or become unavailable.

6. **Code bugs:** Coding errors or bugs in the API can lead to downtime.

7. **Maintenance or upgrades:** Scheduled or unscheduled maintenance or upgrades to the API or its dependencies can cause the API to become unavailable temporarily.

8. **Security incidents:** Security incidents such as DDoS attacks, hacking, and other malicious activities can cause an API to become unavailable or slow down.

9. **Dependencies:** If an API depends on other services or databases to function, failures in these dependencies can result in API downtime.

10. **Configuration errors:** Misconfigured servers, firewalls, or databases can cause an API to become unavailable.

11. **Human error:** Accidental deletion of files, incorrect changes to configurations, and other human errors can cause an API to fail.

### The Real Cost of API Downtimes

API downtime can have a significant impact on businesses and organizations that rely on API services for critical operations. When APIs fail, in most cases the following is at stake:

- Additional costs for businesses, such as the cost of fixing the issue.
- The cost of lost productivity.
- The cost of providing compensation to affected customers.
- In some cases, downtime can result in legal repercussions, such as lawsuits or penalties for breach of contract.
- The cost of damage to brand reputation

Moreover, API downtime can also have a negative impact on the development of new applications and services, as developers may be unable to access the API they need to build their solutions. This can slow down the pace of innovation and prevent new products and services from reaching the market.

Additionally, API downtime can impact the reputation of the API provider. Let’s say an API provider experiences repeated downtime, it can damage its reputation and lead to loss of trust from its customers and partners.

### Our Founder’s API Downtime Story

Our founder, [Anthony Alaribe](https://twitter.com/tonialaribe), once had an excruciating experience with API downtime. This, eventually, led to the birth of APIToolkit.

Hear him out:

> A few years ago, I was a new hire at a food delivery company, migrating a legacy service from PHP to Golang. We implemented the fields listed in the swagger docs, and compared the responses from the legacy service to the responses of the new service, fixing differences until everything matched.
>
> After weeks of implementation and testing, we rolled out the new service after running tests to make sure everything worked as expected. But immediately we looked at our order monitoring charts, we knew we had messed up. Within 10 minutes, 20k orders were lost. I was terrified! What happened?
>
> Apparently, in a couple of countries we ran in, a particular field that was expected by the apps was no longer being sent, preventing the placing of orders. We had no idea since this field was not in the inherited documentation, and was only applicable in a couple of countries that were not part of the samples we manually tested.
>
> We rolled back and fixed the issue, but I was sad that there was no tool that could have detected this issue faster.
>
> Years later, this is that tool (APIToolkit), and we would love to listen to similar stories you’ve experienced and help make such stories a thing of the past.
