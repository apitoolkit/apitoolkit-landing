# Reduce API downtime and Errors with APItoolkit API observability

![alt](./api-downtime.avif)
API downtime refers to the period when an API becomes unavailable or unresponsive, preventing applications and services from accessing and utilizing its functionality. This can occur due to various reasons, such as server overload, infrastructure issues, or bugs within the API itself.

API errors, on the other hand, are specific issues or exceptions that arise during the communication process between the client and the API. These errors can manifest in various forms, such as authentication failures, invalid data, timeouts, or other protocol-specific errors.
